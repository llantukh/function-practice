This assignment was designed to help us practice functions. Each file has several word problems
that we had to build functions for. I am really struggling with this at the moment. The first couple of problems aren't too bad, but as soon as they start getting even a little bit more complicated, I get lost. The thing I get hung up on the most is figuring out which steps I actually need to take; and it usually ends up being more complicated than I expect. Things that make sense together in my head have to be split into separate lines of code. I am also having a little bit of trouble knowing when to use quotation marks and parenthesis.

Hopefully this will all come together with time. Brit said to not freak out...so this is me not freaking out.

So I have been working on the arrays file for a couple hours now....and nothing makes sense. At all.

Edit: it's been a few days, I turned this assignment in and got feedback and went back to make corrections. I definitely understand everything more now and feel much more comfortable with functions and for loops. I had a pretty huge aha moment today while I was working on these and it felt really good. :D
